# IMU_Visualizer

The code that was used for me MSEE Thesis project to visualize the GyroGlove motion on Panda3D

This code takes position data from the Matlab process and controls the Panda3D visualization of the finger positions.

NOTE: I did this project long before I was knowledable about PEP-8 or any real modern Python standards.. I will go through and PEP-8 it in time...
